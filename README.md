Note Mood addresses this challenge by fostering self-awareness through a journaling application. This application leverages machine learning to analyze user-written journals,extracting and classifying entities (e.g., "Person: John") and sentiment (e.g., "Positive"). Beyond basic analysis, Note Mood empowers users with comprehensive visualizations.Daily emotional trends are depicted graphically, revealing the frequency and percentage of positive, negative, and neutral entries over time. Additionally, the application identifies frequently recurring topics and analyzes the sentiment associated with each. This multifaceted approach equips users with a deeper understanding of their emotional landscape and the factors influencing it. By promoting self-reflection and emotional intelligence, Note Mood empowers individuals to navigate the complexities of modern life with greater clarity and purpose. In order to achieve our goal, we take the journals of users and analyzed them, printing the overall mood to the user based on their journal using the sentiment analysis model. Then, using the Attention-based aspect extraction model, we extract all the aspects from the journals and present them to the user as the reasons for their overall mood. After
extracting the aspects, we also determine the sentiment of each aspect. Additionally, we extract the main topics of the journal using the same Attention-based aspect extraction model, providing deeper insights into the content. We developed our web application using React, with its main purpose to help people understand and manage their emotions effectively.
