# Note Mood 🧠💬

> A smart journaling web application that empowers users to understand, track, and reflect on their emotions using AI-powered sentiment and aspect analysis.

## 📰 About the Project

**Note Mood** is a graduation project featured in [Al-Watan newspaper](https://alwan.elwatannews.com/news/details/7451400/note-mood) 🎓.  
It aims to foster emotional awareness and mental well-being by analyzing users’ daily journals using advanced machine learning techniques.

Users can write personal journals, and our system processes these entries to:
- Analyze the overall mood (positive, negative, neutral).
- Extract **aspects** (e.g., "Work", "Family", "Health") and identify the sentiment toward each.
- Identify the most **frequent topics** in their life.
- Visualize emotional trends over time in a meaningful way.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Sentiment Analysis Model** analyzes the mood of each journal entry.
2. **Attention-based Aspect Extraction Model** detects specific entities and topics discussed.
3. Each aspect is then analyzed for individual sentiment.
4. Comprehensive **charts** and **reports** are generated to help users understand emotional triggers.
